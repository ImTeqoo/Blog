            <p><h4><b>Why I Joined this Class</b></h4></p>
            <p>I joined this class because, for the longest time I've wanted to learn how to program but I never knew where to start and I just couldn't find the ample amount of time to do it on my own, so when I heard that we were going to introduce a coding class I jumped at the opportunity to join. Plus this is my last year of highschool so I want to try and get involved and learn as much as possible since its FREE!</p>
